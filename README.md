# NotiQuiet

HASHBANG Productions â€“ Ben Rosen. Adam Demasi.

Sometimes you want to watch a video, play a game, or get work done without any distractions. NotiQuiet can disable push notifications while specific apps are open. They will still appear ni the notification center.

We've put a ton of work into this tweak and we hope you love it!

This package depends on [Cephei 1.6](https://github.com/hbang/libcephei). This is on the BigBoss repo, but can also be compiled and installed on your device with [kirb/theos](https://github.com/kirb/theos).

# Functionality

NotiQuiet is the easiest way to stay concentrated. Hide notifications when you are in specific apps. Enjoy!
